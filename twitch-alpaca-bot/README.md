## Twitch Chat Trading Bot README
- This is a full-stack application created by Theo Dryden to generate excitement around financial education by creating the opportunity to discuss assets/investing on live social media platforms (Twitch) using REAL-TIME trading algorithms.  

**How it works**
- The linked trading account started with $100,000
- Participants discussed their stock investment ideas before placing a trade in the chat of https://www.twitch.tv/theodrydentech
- Trades are placed by typing "!trade direction stock quantity" in Twitch chat : e.g. "!trade buy AAPL 100" / "!trade sell AAPL 100" 
- Participants can see the portfolio performance of the trading account by visiting the website:
- Orders placed outside of market hours will be fulfilled later on
